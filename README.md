OBJECTIVE-Clustering of Iris Dataset
Performed by 
# vIKRAM SINGH

The main objective is to predict the optimal number of clusters from the given "Iris" dataset, K-Mean Algorithm
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

STEPS OF K-MEAN ALGORITHM

Step 1: Choose the number of clusters k

Step 2: Select k random points from the data as centroids

Step 3: Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid

Step 4: Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters

Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4

Stopping Criteria for K-Means Clustering

There are essentially three stopping criteria that can be adopted to stop the K-means algorithm:

1.Centroids of newly formed clusters do not change

2.Points remain in the same cluster

3.Maximum number of iterations are reached
